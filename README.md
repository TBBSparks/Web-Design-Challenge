# Web-Design-Challenge

Take a look at my design here: https://tbbsparks.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations previously created. Results include a landing page, a page to see a comparisons of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
